# BeeMyVal 🐝💌

BeeMyVal is a love-themed web experience designed to help users ask someone special to be their Valentine in a more thoughtful and memorable way. Instead of a simple text message, BeeMyVal transforms the moment into a small, emotional digital experience.


## 👥 Project Team
- **Prisca Onyemaechi**
- **Daniel Chisom**


## 📖 Case Study Summary

BeeMyVal is a web-based platform that transforms the simple “Will you be my Valentine?” message into a more thoughtful and emotionally engaging digital experience. It is designed to help users express affection with confidence, especially in situations where distance, shyness, or impersonal messaging can make romantic expression difficult.

The project focuses on:
- Using **semantic HTML** to build a well-structured and accessible interface
- Creating an emotionally engaging flow for users
- Collaborating effectively using **GitHub branches and pull requests**
- Translating a design concept into a functional web application

The experience guides users through creating a personalized Valentine message, previewing it, and delivering it in a way that feels intentional and special.
